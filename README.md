# Research Image Classification Face And Limbs

## Classifying teammates from a research group and limb movements from the arms and legs.

This Project contains 2 Sub-goal / Milestones of this research project:
- https://github.com/kryan225/Research---Cerebral-Palsy-Detection
  
### OVERVIEW

#### GOAL
The purpose of this project is to understand the image classication capabilities that AWS Sagemaker provides.
Once a deeper level of understanding is reached, my team will decide if Sagemaker should be utilized and if the same hyperparameters should be used when dealing with baby accelerometer data.

Ultimately, once an image classification model is completed and is proved to have a reliable accuracy, the same concepts and model will be moved to the nicu data to predict signs of cerebral palsy in premature babies
